As a sensitivity analysis because of missing data, models were run using imputed data for alive patients with consent who were missing symptom data",Low risk,"RT modality trial so cannot blind physicians/patients. They blinded the neuropsychologists grading the assessments (most important to blind).

They list individual AE for a complete review of systems and by each grade for each treatment arm. They also have a smaller table regarding the AEs they say are more likely to be related to treatment. This is one of the few studies you can pull data from for AE.,Low,,Low,this was the best study for AE reporting.,Data needs to be checked as published study is now the primary and data was abstracted using the prelim data,double checked,
